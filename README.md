# Overview
History Helper is a tool designed to assist with generating patient histories based on old records. It takes existing historical data for returning patients and creates fresh, customized histories for use in medical, administrative, or other settings. This tool helps streamline the process of updating patient records while maintaining a personalized touch.

# Features
- **Data-Driven History Generation.** Utilizes old patient histories to create new, relevant entries for returning patients.
- **Customizable Outputs.** The generated histories can be tailored to fit specific format necessary for each appointment.
- **User-Friendly Interface.** Built with a simple and intuitive design to allow easy input and output of data.

# Known Issues
- Not mobile-responsive. Employees at Animal Medical Center of Seattle are expected to only use History Helper on the computers provided to them on the premises, so mobile compatability is not especially low priority.
